//Using the complete K&S model 2 computer (https://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~ian/KandS2/machine.html), 
//this program takes two integers (The user must store these values in memory locations 9 and 10) and 
//if the first number is equal or greater than the second, the difference is stored at the memory 
//location 11. The sum is stored otherwise.

0: LOAD R0 9
1: LOAD R1 10
2: SUB R2 R0 R1
3: BNEG 6
4: SUB R2 R1 R0
5: BRANCH 7
6: ADD R2 R1 R0
7: STORE 11 R2
8: HALT
