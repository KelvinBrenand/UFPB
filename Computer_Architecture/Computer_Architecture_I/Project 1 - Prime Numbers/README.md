# Project Description

### Project 1 - Prime Numbers

Write a program that prompts a user from the standard input to type an integer. Then, this program should call a function that determines whether the number entered is prime or not (the return of the function must be 0 or 1). Then, the program should print a message to the user informing if the number entered was prime or not. Finally, the program should ask the user if he wants to enter a new number to be verified. If the answer is affirmative, the program must be repeated. If not, the program must be closed.
